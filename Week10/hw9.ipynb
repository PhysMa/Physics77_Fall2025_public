    "## **Question 1**: Power Method for Finding Maximum Eigenvalue\n",
    "\n",
    "The **power method** is an iterative algorithm for finding the largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) of a matrix. It's particularly useful for large sparse matrices where computing all eigenvalues would be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "For a square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, an **eigenvector** $\\mathbf{v}$ and its corresponding **eigenvalue** $\\lambda$ satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Every square matrix has eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_n$ (some may be complex or repeated). We order them by absolute value: $|\\lambda_1| \\geq |\\lambda_2| \\geq ... \\geq |\\lambda_n|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dominant eigenvalue** is $\\lambda_1$ (the one with largest absolute value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power Method Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The power method is based on a simple observation: if we repeatedly multiply a vector by matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the result will increasingly point in the direction of the dominant eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Start with a random unit vector $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ (where $||\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}|| = 1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate** for $k = 1, 2, ..., N$:\n",
    "   - Multiply by $\\mathbf{A}$: $\\mathbf{y}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)}$\n",
    "   - Normalize: $\\mathbf{x}^{(k)} = \\frac{\\mathbf{y}^{(k)}}{||\\mathbf{y}^{(k)}||}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract eigenvalue**: After $N$ iterations, $\\mathbf{x}^{(N)}$ approximates the dominant eigenvector. The corresponding eigenvalue can be computed using the **Rayleigh quotient**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda_1 \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}}{\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The denominator equals 1 since $\\mathbf{x}$ is a unit vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does This Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ can be written as a linear combination of eigenvectors:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}^{(0)} = c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 + ... + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After $k$ multiplications by $\\mathbf{A}$:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}^k \\mathbf{x}^{(0)} = c_1 \\lambda_1^k \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^k \\mathbf{v}_2 + ... + c_n \\lambda_n^k \\mathbf{v}_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $|\\lambda_1| > |\\lambda_i|$ for $i > 1$, the term $\\lambda_1^k$ grows fastest, and the vector increasingly points toward $\\mathbf{v}_1$.\n",

    "2. Compute the true function values: $f(x) = e^x + \\sin(x)$ for all x in the range\n",
    "3. For each order $n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N$:\n",
    "   - Compute the Taylor approximation at each x value using `taylor_approximation(n, x, x_0)`\n",
    "   - Plot these values\n",
    "4. Create a legend showing which line corresponds to which order\n",
    "5. Return the figure object\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Input `N` is the maximum order to plot (integer $\\geq 0$)\n",
    "- Input `x_0` is the center point of the Taylor series (float)\n",
    "- Create a range of at least 200 x values from $x_0 - 5$ to $x_0 + 5$\n",
    "- Plot the true function as a thick black line with label \"True function\"\n",
    "- Plot each Taylor approximation (orders 0 through N) with different colors\n",
    "- Label each approximation as \"Order 0\", \"Order 1\", ..., \"Order N\"\n",
    "- Include axis labels: \"x\" and \"f(x)\"\n",
    "- Include title: \"Taylor Series Approximation of $e^x + \\sin(x)$ centered at $x_0 = $ {x_0:.1f}\"\n",
    "- Include a legend\n",
    "- Include a vertical dashed line at $x_0$ to show the center point\n",
    "- Return the matplotlib figure object\n",

    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `N`: int, maximum order of Taylor series to plot\n",
    "- `x_0`: float, center point of the Taylor series\n",
    "- `show_plot`: bool, default False. If True, call `plt.show()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- `fig`: matplotlib figure object containing the plot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use `np.linspace(...)` to create the x range\n",
    "- Use a loop to plot each order's approximation\n",
    "- You can use a list comprehension to compute approximations: `[taylor_approximation(n, xi, x_0) for xi in x_range]`\n",
    "- Use `plt.axvline(x_0, linestyle='--', color='gray', alpha=0.5)` to add the vertical line at center\n",
    "- Use different line styles or colors for different orders (matplotlib will auto-cycle colors)"
