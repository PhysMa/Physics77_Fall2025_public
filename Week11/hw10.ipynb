    "The **Lorenz equations** are a system of three coupled ordinary differential equations that were originally derived by Edward Lorenz in 1963 as a simplified model of atmospheric convection. These equations are famous for exhibiting **chaotic behavior** - extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, popularly known as the \"butterfly effect.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lorenz System\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lorenz equations are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sigma(y - x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(\\rho - z) - y$$\n",

    "**Standard Parameters:** For this problem, we'll use the classic chaotic regime parameters:\n",
    "- $\\sigma = 10$\n",
    "- $\\rho = 28$\n",
    "- $\\beta = 8/3$\n",
    "\n",
    "With these parameters, the system exhibits the famous \"Lorenz attractor\" - a butterfly-shaped strange attractor that represents chaotic dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Integration: Explicit Euler Method\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this system numerically, we'll use the **Explicit Euler method** (also called Forward Euler). This is the simplest time-stepping scheme for ordinary differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a differential equation $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\mathbf{u})$ and a time step $\\Delta t$, the Explicit Euler method updates the solution from time $t$ to $t + \\Delta t$ using:\n",

    "# **Question 3**: Numerical Integration with the Trapezoid Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical integration (also called **quadrature**) is the process of approximating the definite integral of a function when we either don't have a closed-form antiderivative or only have discrete data points. This is essential in scientific computing where data often comes from experiments or simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given discrete data points $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, we want to approximate the integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{x_0}^{x_n} y(x) \\, dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Trapezoid Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Trapezoid Rule** is one of the simplest and most intuitive methods for numerical integration. The key idea is to approximate the area under the curve $y(x)$ by dividing it into trapezoids rather than rectangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Between any two consecutive points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$, we approximate the curve with a straight line (linear interpolation). The area under this line segment is a trapezoid with:\n",
    "- Parallel sides of height $y_i$ and $y_{i+1}$\n",
    "- Width $h_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of one trapezoid is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_i = \\frac{1}{2}(y_i + y_{i+1}) \\cdot h_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n$ intervals (meaning $n+1$ data points), the total integral approximation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{x_0}^{x_n} y(x) \\, dx \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{2}(y_i + y_{i+1})(x_{i+1} - x_i)$$\n"
